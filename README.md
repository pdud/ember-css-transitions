# Ember CSS Transitions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg) [![Ember Observer Score](https://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-css-transitions.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-css-transitions)

This addon provides a nice way of defining CSS Transitions for Ember Components. Which means, only css based animations for performance - and no animation library needed.

Ember CSS Transitions is heavily inspired (and CSS compatible) with:

- [Vue's CSS Transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html)

Animations are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class attached to a HTML element, you can apply animations to it.


## Documentation

- [https://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/](https://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/)

## How it works

**Utimately you define your animations and transitions with ONLY CSS.**

```css
.example-enter {
  opacity: 0.01;
}

.example-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}

.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

.example-leave-active {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}
```

```hbs
<div {{css-transition name="example"}}>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
```

or by manually specifying classes, perfect for libraries like [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```hbs
<div {{css-transition enterClass="example-enter" enterActiveClass="example-enter-active" leaveClass="example-leave" leaveActiveClass="example-leave-active"}}>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
```

## Install

**Note** Using ember-cli-autoprefixer is suggested for CSS transitions:

```
ember install ember-cli-autoprefixer
```
